## Running the Code

Each notebook is self-contained and includes all required imports and function definitions. To run the notebooks:

1. Ensure required files are in the same directory as the notebook (e.g., `china_map.png` and `china_map_values.csv` for Challenge 2).  
2. Run all cells in order from top to bottom.  
3. The implementation automatically detects column names in the CSV file.  
4. Final results include individual processing steps and a comprehensive analysis dashboard.
